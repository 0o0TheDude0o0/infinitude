Scrape Infinity
==============

Uses Priya/phantomjs and n1k0/casperjs to login to scrape thermostat data from mycarriertouch.com site.

Only tested on my own single zone Carrier Infinity Touch thermostat, 
but I'd welcome patches from anyone with multiple zones or an original Infinity series.

With any luck, Carrier will allow the owners of this data direct access rather
than this ridiculous work around. If you have one of these thermostats, tell
Carrier you'd like access!

Can the Flash/Air application be scraped or controlled? Input welcomed. I miss my Proliphix.
