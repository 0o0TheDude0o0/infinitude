###Scrape Infinity

#### ***It would be much better to use the local webservice, but I'll leave this here just in case it's useful to someone***


Uses [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs) and [CasperJS](https://github.com/n1k0/casperjs) to login and scrape thermostat data from https://www.myinfinitytouch.carrier.com/.

Only tested on my own single zone Carrier Infinity Touch thermostat, 
but I'd welcome patches from anyone with multiple zones or an original Infinity series.

####Usage
After setting your username and password:

    ./scrape_infinity.sh
